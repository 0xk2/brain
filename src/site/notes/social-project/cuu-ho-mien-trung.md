In 2020, there was a [historically big flood in the middle of Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Central_Vietnam_floods). It was late at night, and I got a call from a friend asking for help to organize a team of devs trying to gather SOS messages in social networks and distribute them to rescuers. It caught my interest immediately, so I spent the night & early morning meeting with them and produced this diagram within several hours. By the next morning, I was the Project Manager and started leading this squad.

This diagram could be better, but by producing it in those early hours of this tiny org, we were able to coordinate coherently and successfully scale this team to more than 2,000 volunteers working remotely all around the world within two weeks.

Noon time the next day, when I was having lunch and watching the news on TV about how the army was bringing specialized vehicles to rescue people, I realized I made a deadly mistake in the diagram. (1) The flood is so extreme that in some areas, it was nearly. Impossible to go through without hardware, especially when it got dark (electricity was cut off for many days). (2) In this kind of flood, Google Maps or any civilian navigation is useless because there is no road, no bridge, no landmark, no phone tower, no electricity, and nothing for you to navigate. It was just water everywhere.

Due to those two reasons, we MUST wait to deliver the SOS message to rescuers immediately because most of them lack the hardware and expertise to navigate in such situations, and I MIGHT BRING THEM TO DANGER. Instead, we should bring both the SOS message & rescuer info to the army and local authorities so they can organize many smaller task teams. We can be a communication channel between them and the people in distress. Knowing this, I acted immediately, and we started calling the army and local authorities. But, how can we get the Army's attention when they are super busy and we were no one and our info was authentic but not validated by anyone?

We started by emailing a high-ranking army official and using the acknowledge email to recruit other local authorities. Deceit and reckless, yes. But, this is the only way!

I also use media & newspapers to validate our authenticity. Within a week, we onboarded almost most province leaders (Hà Tĩnh, Quảng Bình, Quảng Trị, Quảng Ngãi, Đà Nẵng, Bình Định …) and show them how our data can save lives. This was an unprecedented event for everyone!

By onboarding the local authority, we gained the popularity of professional and semi-professional rescue communities. However, we had another problem: how to get as much information as possible. We need hundreds of volunteers to make sure the hotline is working (and we must keep it as a free-toll number!) and, we need people to scout the social network for any SOS messages manually; also, the window for rescue is only 24-48 hours for a family got stuck in the roof of a house in a rural area. We need people to validate and constantly update our data!

I solve this by (1) going all-in in social media and (2) showing everyone in the volunteer community that we are super transparent: we have daily updates on what we are doing.

I was very careful at the time to eliminate any individual name in social media messages to make sure people came to us for the right reason! (no fame, money, or benefit and it is hard work: if you want to save people, come to us!)

This tactic reminded every volunteer several times a day of why they were doing this and they became super aggressive in recruiting their friends & family.

I also opened the data API for any tech team to use and invite others to give us data. Fully aware of the risk of data privacy, but there is no win without trade-off. I took the risk, and it worked; we got partners who visualize our data in their own unexpected way. Partners make our database grow faster

By the end of the campaign, we had an organization of 2,000+ volunteers working tirelessly on every front; we helped save hundreds of lives and were nominated for various social awards. Moreover, I have shown several thousands of people how powerful they are when they work together for a worthy cause!

This instance is not a one-off event; I have shown several times to MYSELF that I can demonstrate exceptional creativity or perseverance in stressful situations.

**Summary:**

In 2020, there was a big flood in Vietnam, and I led a social project to crawl social networks for SOS messages, process the data and forward them to potential civilian rescuers. However, after the system was built and work was on the way, I found out that the flood was so severe most rescuers would endanger themselves if they went into the flood zone without military-grade equipment which they did not have (no electricity in a vast region, no GPS and the flood changed the landscape, vortexes were many and strong). Over the night, we found new partners within the government and military and changed the tactics to forwarding SOS messages to the military, actively connecting the military with civilian rescuers and keeping all parties synced on the status of the flood-trapped civilians. These changed tactics brought good results because we managed to help rescue several hundreds of lives without endangering the rescuers. The instance taught me a lot about leadership; it is not about being right but admitting wrong and making changes.
