**Keynote**
- Focus on founder product fit, how we can build the product and get the product running (know the people)
	- Hieu: DAO journey (superteam), social initiatives
	- Linh: how the struggle with re-building bank governance is the inspiration to build the product?
- Side note:
	- Web2 to Web3 technical design -> record & talk about it
	- Thought behind SyncVote and how big it can be (different docs)

**Product**
- Demo -> Integrate: Squads & Twitter
	- What has been done before the hackathon, what is new?
	- Can I use the back end to build a side/fun product?
- Showcase: Boo? a DAO found by Cap, superteam UK lead

Additional:
- @xoao3 wants to help; he is a designer (like Loc) & community manager.
	- Stay in London, It's really good to expand the team and make it international.
	- He won a Near hackathon to build decentralized Universities, which SyncVote can become the infra "One sentence pitch idea: There are many individual educators on Udemy, Skillshare, etc., but there is no decentralized university because they lack a platform to work together -> build that."
