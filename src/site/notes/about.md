### Community activities

---

- 2009: I was the Campus Ambassador, Sun Microsystem at my university. My job was holding tech events on Open Source technology for my peer, showing them the latest version of Net Beans or how to use JDK, and sometimes just introducing a new version of Open Office. The job was excellent, with a mix of presentation and technical understanding. This job show me the Open Source community and I was an assistant to Mr John Hall ‚Äòmaddog‚Äô - the CEO of Linux International when he was in Hanoi, in 2009. This job helped shaped my professional direction profoundly. Everything I do, from tech stack to culture, is always the FOSS way.
- 2008-2010: I found an ICT club which offers my peers practical knowledge of the software industry. The club did offer free knowledge to a few hundred members and many of them later became leaders in many big tech corporate in Vietnam, e.g: Tiki, Viettel, etc. Some of them found web3 startups, such as Wanaka Farm.
- 2019 & 2020: Within two weeks in late 2020, I led a team of 2,000 volunteers to run an emergency information portal. This portal ([https://kenh14.vn/he-thong-cuu-ho-mien-trung-ra-doi-tu-nhung-loi-keu-cuu-khi-xa-hoi-co-nhung-noi-dau-lon-se-co-nhung-nhom-nhu-chung-toi-cung-tap-hop-lai-20210115155625331.chn](https://kenh14.vn/he-thong-cuu-ho-mien-trung-ra-doi-tu-nhung-loi-keu-cuu-khi-xa-hoi-co-nhung-noi-dau-lon-se-co-nhung-nhom-nhu-chung-toi-cung-tap-hop-lai-20210115155625331.chn)) helped save hundreds of lives. This time, I had set up an efficient command structure consisting of many functional teams, such as media, government relations, operation and tech. I also showed them how to conduct meetings and write reports that online volunteers can work seamlessly together in distressed situations. I was able to replicate the model in the Covid-19 crisis for ‚ÄúAccompanying Doctors‚Äù¬†[https://thaythuocdonghanh.vn/](https://thaythuocdonghanh.vn/)¬†in 2021. This time, I was an advisor and helped structure a response team of 10,000 health workers to provide online support to millions of patients.

- Nov 2022 - now: I am dev rel for Solana Superteam Vietnam. My job is promoting Solana technology in Vietnamese Dev community, hosting workshop & training events, etc. I helped grow the Solana Superteam Commuinty to 3,000+ Discord members, most of them are developers. In 2023, we helped onboard more than a thousand devs into Solana ecosystem through more than 10 hackathons, 100+ technical workshop sessions both online and offline. I am proud to help build one of the most vibrant blockchain developer community in South East Asia.

### Tech startups

---

- 2011 - 2015: I found TerraBook, a mobile content startup that pursues the vision that mobile apps can help parents and teachers effectively educate their children through entertaining content. This startup gain hundreds of thousands of users and millions of views on its Youtube channel ([https://youtube.com/terrabookvn](https://youtube.com/terrabookvn))
- 2015 - 2017: I found Edumall within Topica Edtech Group, a short course platform for anyone to share their knowledge with anyone else and make a living from it. These products served millions of users, provided thousands of courses and became the top 1 in Vietnam and Thailand markets.
- 2018 - 2022: I was CEO of Upinus - a tech supply chain company serving the dropshipping market. The company served an annual GMV of $ 60M. Later, I opened an e-logistics service (VCS) for Vietnamese manufacturers to sell (online) and ship directly to global customers.
- 2022 - now: I am co-founder of [Hectagon Finance](https://hectagon.finance/), an Investment DAO. The first fund attracted over $ 300K and has been investing in 2 Web3 startups and reviewing hundreds of others. Hectagon is pivoting into [SyncVote](https://syncvote.com/) - a platform to revolutionize the way humans make decisions together.

## Get to know me

I like to write, I mean a lot. For me, sharing is learning. I joined web3 in 2021 and I have been maintaining a Twitter account ([https://twitter.com/0xk2_](https://twitter.com/0xk2_)) dedicated to web3 ever since. In this account, I wrote extensively on my authentic findings in web3. For example, these are some of my favourite tweets (they are technical long tweets).

I am able to give talks quite well, and I really enjoy interacting with crowds. I have been a mentor, and speaker in multiple tech events, startup contests, hackathons, tech meetups and sharing for many years. I also helped organize one hackathon when I was in Topica.

Oh, a side note, I love hackathons. Like, a lot!

Today I am working at Hectagon & Solana Superteam Vietnam. I am also a member of LXDAO and 8DAO. Blockchain is where we can work together, grow the community together and build a new better world together so contact me if you find me can be useful to your cause. WAGMI !!!
